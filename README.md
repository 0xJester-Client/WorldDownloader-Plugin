<p align="center"> <b> About: </b> </p>
<p> 
This project is no longer being worked on as its for 1.12.2 we're moving to 1.19.2 plus new client.

My original plan: Was to Auto Elytra Fly around Const downloading and mapping the world to then create a private site where we can view all
the data.

This is a world utility addon that allows the user to download the minecraft world to their local machine alongside extra features such 
as an embedded database that stores chunk data (NewChunks & Block Count).

This addon also provides the user a Minimap that shows the current chunk they are in and the chunks they have already visited.

I recommend your client thread count to 6+ for the best performance. This addon rely on the client thread manger heavily (Minimap).
